# Want to create a model to solve the ultimate human question: What should we eat for this meal? (To be refined)

## Creating a Model to Decide What to Eat

1. **Define Your Dataset**: Start by gathering a diverse set of recipes. Include dish names, ingredients, preparation time, and dietary restrictions. The broader your dataset, the more personalized your suggestions can be.
2. **Determine Conditions for Suggestions**: Consider factors like:

   - Time of day (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
   - Dietary preferences (vegetarian, low-carb)
   - Available ingredients
   - Desired cooking time
   - Nutritional goals

   These conditions help tailor suggestions to individual needs.
3. **Create the Suggestion Algorithm**: Start with a simple algorithm that selects dishes randomly based on set conditions. Evolve this to include user preferences, nutritional balance, and shopping list generation.
4. **Implement and Iterate**: Build your model as a script or app. Test extensively to refine its performance. Use early user feedback to make improvements.
5. **Expand and Enhance**: Add features like nutritional analysis, user rating systems, and grocery shopping integrations. Continually update your model based on feedback and new insights.
